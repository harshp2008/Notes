# Art of Attribution

I believe any piece of work, regardless of how small it may be, should have be given proper attributions. The Author meta-data below the tilte was specially coded in for this purpose. But in addition to attribution it also shows who to keep accountable for a piece of note, so proper feedback can go to the one or ones in charge of writing that part of the notes.

But Attribution goes much deeper than that. Read [[Authoring Content and Citing]] for more information.
