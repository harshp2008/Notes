# Introduction

Thanks for considering to contribute to this knowledge garden. Before going through with the setup process I will briefly explain how this all works. 

All notes are written in a language called ==Markdown==, a incredibly simple but powerful language that can incorporate HTML and CSS. 

The text-editior of choice can be as simple as notepad but I strongly recommend everyone to use ==Obsidian==. Obsidian is an incredibly powerful markdown editor, with tones of plugins that just makes your life so much better and it's open source like this notes and it's run by an incredible community of developers and users. I love it.

After writing your Markdown Notes, everything will be published to Github, (an online code repository), and will be converted to a nice looking website, which is basically the one you are reading off right now. It does this conversion using Quartz 4.0. It's an open-source static site generator. 

We use Github to keep track of big changes, and publish the notes to a website and Dropbox to instantly sync your notes with every other devices accessing a copy of obsidian with this notes.

Without further ado let's Setup your PC for Notetaking.
