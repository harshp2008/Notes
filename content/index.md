This is a collection of Personal Notes related to school and studies. The main notes heavily focuses on IBDP but has expansions to other levels of complicity. For example for physics, I plan to write notes for JEE too.

# My Reasons to write Note

I originally to chose to write this notes as I wanted to digitalise my hand-written notes but also thought that writing online notes would be faster and more accessible from anywhere. A simple reason. 

But as I continued to write notes, it became a bit harder to take time out to write them and I also didn't really know whether my notes were of the "best-quality". So I chose to make this public and allow others to share doubts, questions and actively contribute. I am hopping that with a bit of integrity, the collective knowledge will help create "High-quality"  notes, which are informative, easy to understand and also concise but leave enough room to dive into the nitty gritty of the complexity of the topic.

# Contribution

Without the amazing people behind obsidian and quartz 4.0, making a knowledge garden like this notes would not be possible and I would like to mention them. But proper attribution should also go for the ones that are helping me to write this notes.

So here are a list of them:

For now there is only me or just an handful, but I hope it can grow through contributions.
