# Describing Motion (Kinematics)

> [!info] Define Scalar
>
> - A scalar is a physical quantity that has size but no direction
> - Examples:
>   - Distance
>   - Speed
>   - Work Done and Energy
>   - Power
>   - Mass
>   - <u>Temperature</u>
>     (may have positive and negative values but still has **no inherit direction** thus it is a **scalar**)

> [!info] Define Vector
>
> - A vector is a physical quantity that has size and direction
> - <u>Examples:</u> - Displacement - Velocity - Acceleration - Force - Time
>   <br>
> - Any unit that relies on a vector quantity is a vector
> - <u>Examples:</u> - Pressure = Force / Area - Force is a **Vector** and Area is a **Scalar** > <br> - Momentum = Mass \* Velocity - Mass is a **Scalar** and Velocity is a **Vector**

## Defining kinematic quantities

### Distance Vs Displacement

> [!info] Distance
>
> - The **total length of the path** an object takes, regardless of its starting or ending point.
> - Distance is a **scalar** quantity
> - Si unit is ==meter==
> - Distance is denoted with a ==" d "==

> [!info] Displacement
>
> - The **change in position** of an object from its starting point to its ending point.
> - Si unit is ==meter==
> - Displacement is a **vector** quantity.
> - Displacement can be found by drawing a straight line between two points
> - displacement is denoted with a ==" s "==

### Speed Vs Velocity

> [!info] Speed
>
> - Speed is the rate at which an object travels a **distance over time**
> - Si unit is $ms^{-1}$.
> - Speed is a **scalar** quantity
> - Speed can be found by taking the gradient of a distance-time graph
> - Speed is denoted by " $v$ " (italics)
>   
>    $Speed = \dfrac{\triangle distance }{\triangle time}$

> [!info] Velocity
>
> - Velocity is the rate at which an object changes its **displacement over time**.
> - Si unit is $ms^{-1}$.
> - Velocity is a **vector** quantity.
> - Velocity can be found by taking the gradient of a displacement-time graph
> - Speed is denoted by " $v$" (bold)
>   
>     $veloctiy = \dfrac{ds}{dt}$

#### Average Speed vs Velocity

> [!info] Average Speed
>
> - Average speed is the **total distance** travelled divided by the total time taken.
> - Average Speed is a **scalar**
> - Average speed is **always positive** and ==doesn't indicate the direction of motion==.
> - Can be found by taking the area under a d-t graph and dividing by the time
>   
>   $Average \space Speed = \dfrac{total \space distance}{time}$

> [!info] Average Velocity
>
> - Average velocity is the displacement divided by the time.
> - Average Speed is a **vector**.
> - Can be found by taking the area under a s-t graph and dividing by the time
>   
>   $Average \space Velocity = \dfrac{displacement}{time} = \dfrac{\triangle \space position}{\triangle \space time}$ 
>
>   $Average \space Velocity = \dfrac{\triangle x_{final} - \triangle x_{initial}}{\triangle t_{final} - \triangle t_{initial}}$

#### Instantaneous Speed vs Velocity

> [!info] Instantaneous Speed
>
> - Instantaneous speed is ==the speed of an object at a specific moment in time==
> - Instantaneous Speed is a **scalar**.
> - can be found by taking the gradient at a specific time value in a d-t graph
>   <br> $Instantaneous \space Speed = \dfrac{distance \space travelled \space at \space time \space t}{t}$

> [!info] Instantaneous Velocity
>
> - Instantaneous speed is ==the velocity of an object at a specific moment in time==
> - Instantaneous Speed is a **vector**.
> - can be found by taking the gradient at a specific time value in a s-t graph
>   
>    $Instantaneous \space Velocity = \dfrac{displacement \space at \space t=T }{T}$

### Acceleration

> [!info] Acceleration
>
> - Acceleration is the rate at which an object changes its **velocity over time**.
> - Si unit is $ms^{-2}$.
> - Acceleration is a **vector** quantity.
> - Acceleration can be found by taking the gradient of a Velocity time graph
> - Speed is denoted by " $a$ "
>   <br> ${acceleration = \dfrac{d^2s}{dt^2} \space or \space \dfrac{velocity}{time \space taken}}$

> [!info] Average Acceleration
>
> - Average velocity is the **overall velocity over the time period**.
> - Average acceleration is a **vector**.
> - Can be found by taking the area under a v-t graph and dividing by the time
>   <br> ${Average \space acceleration = \dfrac{\triangle \space Velocity}{\triangle \space time} = \dfrac{\triangle v - \triangle u}{\triangle t_{2} - \triangle t_{1}}}$

#### Instantaneous acceleration

> [!info] Instantaneous acceleration
>
> - Instantaneous acceleration is ==the acceleration of an object at a specific moment in time==
> - Instantaneous acceleration is a **vector**.
> - can be found by taking the gradient at a specific time value in a v-t graph
>   <br> ${Instantaneous \space acceleration = \dfrac{Velocity \space at \space t=T }{T}}$
