# Introduction

When it comes to physics, there are two words, "Kinematics" and "Kinetics". This two offer two differently ways to solve problems in a branch of physics called dynamics. You will need to utilise the right one in order to solve the question. But before we go on, let's put some context behind this words. 

The word “kinematics” comes from the Greek word "kinēsis", meaning “movement” or “motion”. So “kinematics” means the study of motion and the quantities used to describe it. In layman's term, it utilises equations that connect distance / displacement, speed / velocity and acceleration. Distance and displacement, speed and velocity are not the same, we will explore the differences  later. "Kinematic" is not dependant on forces. 

The word "kinetics" comes from the Greek word "kinētikos", meaning "related to motion". Thus "kinetics" is a study that of motion that deals with how forces affect the motion of an object. This will be further covered in [[Unit A.2 - Forces and Momentum]]

In this Unit, we will only be focusing on Kinematics and we will use this to solve a wide range of problems from the finding a distance covered by an object to solving questions involving the trajectory of a ball as it is slowed down by air resistance.
