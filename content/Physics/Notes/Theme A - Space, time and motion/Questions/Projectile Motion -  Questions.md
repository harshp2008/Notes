#### Question 1

John is throwing a ball of a cliff with an angle $\theta$ with a initial velocity of $u$. The height of where the ball is thrown off from with respect to the foot of the cliff is $S_y$. Given that air resistance is negligible and the gravitation field strength to be $9.8 \space ms^{-2}$

 >[!Warning] TODO : The position of 2T in the image is wrong, it should on the yellow line instead. 
 
 
>[!info] Define unknowns as :
>- initial velocity :  $u = 20 \space ms^{-1}$
>- initial height : $S_y  = 500 \space m$  

##### <u><strong>Warm-up Questions</strong></u>

==Let the angle (θ) to be 0°, i.e the ball is thrown off horizontally of the cliff. In this case your H will be your initial height==

1. Find the time taken for the ball to hit the floor.
2. Find the velocity the ball has just before it hits the floor, thus find speed of the ball at this point

##### <u><strong>Intermediate Questions</strong></u>

==Let the angle (θ) to be 30°==

1. Find the equation for the trajectory of the ball in the air ($s_x$, $s_y$ w.r.t time).
2. Find the time taken for the ball to reach max height.
3. Find the time taken for the ball to hit the floor.
4. Find the velocity the ball has just before it hits the floor, thus find speed of the ball at this point

##### <u><strong>Hard Questions</strong></u>

==John is now able to alter his throwing angle to be any angle between -70° and 70°==

>[!warning] Questions may requires knowledge of calculus to solve


<u>Find:</u>

1.  The angle required to maximise the height that the ball can travel to.
2.  The angle required to maximise the time the ball is in the air.
3. The angle required to maximise the range of the ball (Max horizontal distance). 
4. The angle required to maximise the speed of the ball before it hits the floor.


##### <u><strong>More than Hard but less than Extreme questions</u></strong>

>[!warning] The question requires knowledge of uncertainty which is covered in [[3 - Data analysis and modelling physics]]

==As John is a human and not a robot, his aim accuracy now has a uncertainty of ±5°.== 

John's friend paints a red circle with a radius $(30 \pm 5)\space m$ , which is located on the bottom of the cliff. It is located $(90 \pm 2)\space m$ horizontally from where John stand. John wants the ball to land. ==What are the ranges of angles that john must throw with (before uncertainty in his aim is added) such that it **always lands in the circle**== despite his horrible aim and the very uncertain position and radius of the circle.  

##### <u><strong>Extreme question</strong></u>

>[!warning] Requires knowledge of [[Unit A.3 - Work, Energy and Power | work, energy and power]] and calculus to solve

Given that ball is now able to rebound of the Flat surface below. The ball is allowed to bounce for 4 times. 

50 percent of the energy of the ball is lost after each bounce to heat generated by friction and the sound produced. Assume air resistance to be negligible. 

<u>Find:</u>

1. Find the optimal angle required such that it travels the maximum range. The ball is stopped on the 4th contact with the floor and the horizontal distance is measured. 
   
2. Find the optimal angle required such that it maximises the time of ball in the air . The ball is stopped on the 4th contact with the floor and the time is stopped, the time taken is then measured.

>[!tip] Tip: Use these equations

> - $\text{Kinetic Energy} \space : E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$

###### <u><strong>Hard Questions</u></strong>
