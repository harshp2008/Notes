# Introduction

Forces are the most fundamental core concept of physics. They show up in everyday setting, in every action we take. Understanding them is the key to understanding classical mechanics, a fundamental portion of the IB physics curriculum. But before we move on let's get a vague idea of what a force actually is.

We depend on forces and their effects in all aspects of our life. Forces are sometimes thought of as “pushes or pulls”, but the concept of a force goes well beyond this simple description. Forces will be looked further into in this unit.

In this Unit the following will be explored in advanced:

- What are Forces?
- Effect of Forces
- Type of forces
- Mathematical formules of those specific types of forces.
- Newton's Laws of Motion

Momentum is another concept, that allows us that quantifies the motion possessed by an object. It's basically mass times by the velocity. We will look deeper into momentum in this unit.
