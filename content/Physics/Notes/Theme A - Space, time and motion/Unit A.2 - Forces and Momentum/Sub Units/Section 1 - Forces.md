# What are Forces

Aristotle famously represented a force as anything that causes an object to undergo “unnatural motion”. Sir Isaac Newton was one of the first scientists to study gravity and force. Any kind of force is just a push or a pull. 

>It can be described as a push or pull on an object with a mass.

A Force is a vector property. It has both magnitude and a direction.

# Effect of Forces

>[!info] Changing the state of motion
>
> Force can set an object in motion, stop a moving object, or change its speed or direction: 
>  
> - **Starting motion**: Pushing a box on a table to get it moving 
>  <br>
>  - **Stopping motion**: Catching a ball and making it stop 
>   <br>
> - **Changing speed**: Increasing the speed of a bicycle by pedalling harder 
> <br>
> - **Changing direction**: Changing the direction of a cricket ball after hitting it 
    

>[!info] Changing shape or size
>    
> Force can change the shape or size of an object: 
>    
> - **Changing shape**: Squeezing toothpaste to change its shape 
>  <br>
> - **Changing size**: Using a rolling pin to change a small ball of dough into a larger, flat, circular chapatti 


>[!info] Changing position
>  
> Force can change the position of an object: 
>  
> - **Raising an object**: Raising a ball from the ground to a certain height

# The 4 Fundamental Forces:

There are 4 Fundamental Forces in physics:

- Gravitational Force
- Electromagnetic Force
- Strong Nuclear Force
- Weak Nuclear Force
 
`Gravitational Force` and `Electromagentic Forces` are present ==everywhere== while `Strong Nuclear Force` and `Weak Nuclear Forces` can only be found inside the ==nucleus of a atom==

>[!info] What is Gravitational Force?
>
>>Gravitational force pulls objects with mass toward each other.
>
> - We often think about the force of gravity from Earth. This force is what keeps your body on the ground. 
>	
>	But _any_ object with mass exerts a gravitational force on all other objects with mass. For example, there is a gravitational force between you and every object around you!
>  <br>
>
>- The gravitational force between two objects is larger when the masses of the objects are larger. 
> 	 
> 	 That’s why you can feel the gravitational force between you and Earth, but the force between you and objects with smaller masses is too weak to feel.
><br>
>- The gravitational force between two objects also depends on the distance between their centers. The further objects are from one another, the weaker the force is.
