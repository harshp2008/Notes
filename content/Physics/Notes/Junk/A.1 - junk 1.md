### Example question (Incomplete: requires clarification): 

In 2012, the Red Bull Stratos project set the record for the highest altitude parachute jump when Felix Baumgartner jumped from an altitude of almost 39 km. This record was subsequently broken by Alan Eustace in 2014.

|  $h \space/ m$ | $v\space/m^{-1}$ |
| :-----------:  | :--------------: |
|     38965      |        6.7       |
|     38960      |       11.4       |
|     38955      |       14.4       |
|     38949      |       18.3       |
|     38945      |       20.3       |
|     38940      |       21.7       |
|     38936      |       23.6       |
|                |                  |

The table shows Baumgartner’s speed $v$ at different altitudes h above Earth’s surface.

- Plot a graph of $v^2$ against $h$ 
- Find the gradient of the graph.
- Deduce what the gradient represents. (Hint: use $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$.)

- The absolute uncertainty in the given speeds is ±$1 \space m s^{-1}$. Calculate the uncertainties in the values of $v^2$ and add error bars to your graph.

- By considering the maximum and minimum gradients of your graph, deduce whether the data are consistent with an acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 $ms^{-2}$

- When you have studied Topic D.1 you will be able to calculate the acceleration due to gravity g at an altitude of 39 km. Show that it is only about 1% lower than g at the surface of Earth.

| $h \space/ m$ | $v\space/m^{-1}$ | $v^2 \space/m^{-2}$ |

$v^2 = u^2 + 2as$ => $v^2 = 2a(h) + u^2$

gradient ($2a$) = $-17.7 \space ms^{-2}$

$2a = -17.7 \space ms^{-2}$
$\space\space  a = -8.8 \space\space\space ms^{-2}$

Y-intercept ($u^2$)= $689580 \space m^2s^{-2}$

$u^2 = 689580 \space m^2s^{-2}$
$u\space = 830.4 \space ms^{-1}$  --> actually in this case it is the final speed
