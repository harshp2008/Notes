# Poem

What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?  
<span>&emsp;&emsp;</span>— Only the monstrous anger of the guns.  
<span>&emsp;&emsp;</span>Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle   
 Can patter out their hasty orisons.  
No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells;  
<span>&emsp;&emsp;</span>Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs,—
The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells;  
<span>&emsp;&emsp;</span>And bugles calling for them from sad shires.  

What candles may be held to speed them all? 
<span>&emsp;&emsp;</span>Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes
Shall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes.  
 <span>&emsp;&emsp;</span>The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall;  
Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds,  
And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.
