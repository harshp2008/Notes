## Les temps du verbe

The grammatical term **tense** comes from Old French _tens_, from Latin _tempus_, meaning "time." So a **verb tense** refers to the **time** that the action of a verb occurs. 

French has three tenses:
1. Present
2. Past
3. Future

For simplicity of learning, we will focus on the main tenses. There are other tenses in french that we will be ignoring as they are reserved for: 

- Formal settings
- Literature settings
- Journalism
- Historical Accounts


This few tenses rarely show up in informal conversation and everyday situations. So we can use tenses equivalent to them when their use case shows up.

The French **present tense** has just one verb form:

- [_présent_ | present](https://www.lawlessfrench.com/grammar/present-tense/)

The French **past tense** consists of five verb forms:

- [[La Passé Compose]]
- [[La Passé Recent]]
- [[L'Imparfait]]
- [_plus-que-parfait_ | past perfect (pluperfect)](https://www.lawlessfrench.com/grammar/past-perfect/)

The French **future tense** comes in two varieties:

- [_futur_ | future](https://www.lawlessfrench.com/grammar/future-tense/)


### Verb tense and mood

Verb tense must always be considered with respect to [verb mood](https://www.lawlessfrench.com/grammar/verb-mood/), a separate but related phenomenon. The eight tenses above are all in the indicative mood, which is the default and largest mood. Any given verb form is a combination of one tense and one mood. You can see how they all fit together in my [French verb timeline](https://www.lawlessfrench.com/grammar/verb-timeline/).

### Verb categories

In addition to being grouped by time, verb conjugations can be separated into [simple tenses and compound tenses](https://www.lawlessfrench.com/grammar/simple-compound-tenses-moods/), which is simply a matter of how many words are included in their conjugations.

- _Présent_, _imparfait_, _passé simple_, and _futur_ are simple (one-word) verb conjugations.
- _Passé antérieur_, _passé composé_, _plus-que-parfait_, and _futur antérieur_ are compound (two-word) verb conjugations.

### Special verb groupings

Verb forms are combined in various other ways depending on how they’re used or conjugated, e.g.,

- [Historical tenses](https://www.lawlessfrench.com/grammar/historical-tenses/)
- [Literary tenses](https://www.lawlessfrench.com/grammar/literary-tenses-moods/)
- [Periphrastic tenses](https://www.lawlessfrench.com/grammar/periphrastic-tenses/)

# Tense vs Mood

Tense is about time, Mood is about attitude.

- There are three **Tenses**: present, past, and future – they tell you **when** something happens.
  
- The six **[Moods](https://www.lawlessfrench.com/grammar/verb-mood/)** indicate how the speaker **feels** about what’s happening, whether it’s fact, supposition, command, or possibility.

Every verb form has Tense and Mood – they work together, as you can see in my [French verb timeline](https://www.lawlessfrench.com/grammar/verb-timeline/).
